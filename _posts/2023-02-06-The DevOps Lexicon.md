# Introduction

This is a DevOps lexicon. It is filled with words for things that are hard to describe without them. 

# Describing patterns

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| Treating a derived type as if it were it's base type | Polymorphic | 
| Conforming to the shared pattern of the general context | Idiomatic |
| Peculiar from the norm | Idiosyncratic |
| Wrong, How not to solve recurring problems | Anti-Pattern |
| Code written for a problem | Imperative |
| Code written with no clear statement for a problem | Declarative |
| Something is done for you behind the scenes | Implicit |
| Assigning a Function to a variable | Functional Programming | 
| Associated with Objects/Classes | A Method | 
| A Class using another Class | Coupled |
| Make independent from one another | Decoouple |
| How much decoupling is possible | Modularity |
| Same behaviour each time | Idempotent |
| Classification | Paradigm |
| Good code practises to live by | S.O.L.I.D |
| Run in parallel | Asynchronous |
| Fibonacci Sequence | Dynamic prgramming |
| The foundation on which other things live | Substrate |

# Isolating individuals

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| The start | Prefix
| The end | Suffix 
| Add to end | Append
| Add to start | Prepend
| Add parameter to a request | Decorate request
| Analyse cache/logs | Interrogate
| Parameter | Attribute
| After / in a URL | Context Path / Path
| Scheme, Authority, User Info, Host etc.| URI | 
| Host, Path | URL 
| Similar to Context Path | Request-URI
| Short suffix | Short tail
| Long suffix | Long tail
| Major.Minor.Patch-Pre-release+Metadata | SemVer 

# Describing infrastructure

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| Past transactions used as a reference point | Stateful |
| Previous transactions are not stored or referenced | Stateless |
| Data retained after power turned off | Persistent |
| Volatile, temporary storage | Ephemeral |
| Changeable infrastructure | Mutable |
| Components replaced rather than changed | Immutable
| A change to one component does not affect the other | Orthogonal |
| Transformation of source code into machine readable code | Compile
| Convert object into a stream of bytes to store or transmit | Serialization |
| Unzip | Deserialization


# Project oriented

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| Soak time | Time required to find bugs
| Cut over | Go Live
| Entropy | Rotting over time 
| Yak shaving | Endless small tasks to complete before a next step can be completed
| Batch processing | Data munge | 
| Bio break | Bathroom break |
| Dunning-Kruger effect | Occurs when a person's lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area cause them to overestimate their own competence. And vice versa
| Matrix | Vectors
