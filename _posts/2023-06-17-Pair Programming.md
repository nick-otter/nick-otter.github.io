# How to Pair Program
{: style="text-align: center"}

From [Austin Chadwick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-chadwick-3a58151a4/).

Single-Goal Editing and Pair Programming
"I have this little mantra that I repeat to myself when I’m working: “Programming is the art of doing one thing at a time.” When I’m pairing, I always ask my partner to challenge me on that, to ask me “What are you doing?” If I answer more than one thing, we pick one. I do the same for my partner. Frankly, it’s just faster. When you are programming, it is pretty easy to pick off too big of a chunk at a time. If you do, you end up thrashing and just trying things out to make things work rather than working very deliberately and really knowing what your code does.

...Chances are, you’ve already heard of Pair Programming. If you are using Extreme Programming (XP) as your process you are probably doing it. Good. It is a remarkably good way to increase quality and spread knowledge around a team.

If you aren’t pair programming right now, I suggest that you try it. In particular, I insist that you pair when you use the dependency-breaking techniques I’ve described in this book.

It’s easy to make a mistake and have no idea that you’ve broken the software. A second set of eyes definitely helps. Let’s face it, working in legacy code is surgery, and doctors never operate alone.
