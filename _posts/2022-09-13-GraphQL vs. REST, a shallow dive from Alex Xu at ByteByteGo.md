* GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Meta. It provides a complete description of the data in the API and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need.

* GraphQL servers sit in between the client and the backend services.

* GraphQL can aggregate multiple REST requests into one query. GraphQL server organizes the resources in a graph.

* GraphQL supports queries, mutations (applying data modifications to resources), and subscriptions (receiving notifications on schema modifications).
