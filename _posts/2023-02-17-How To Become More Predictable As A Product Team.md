How to become "more predictable" as a product team:

* Work smaller
* Work together
* Work on less at once
* Start finishing, stop starting
* Regularly integrate your work
* Get feedback "early and often"
* Diverge at first
* Allow the design to emerge
* Focus on flow, adapt scope to time constraints
* Commitment to continuous improvement and learning
* Focus on support systems and tools
* Celebrate wins, build in some down-time
* Visualize the flow of work, bottlenecks, etc.
* Don't worry about predictability. It is a byproduct

How NOT to become "more predictable" as a product team:

* Big-batches
* Work in silos and individual projects
* Pack quarters like a Tetris board
* Start new things when you're blocked
* Parallelize work, and integrate later
* Treat your work as too precious to share
* Converge quickly on a plan
* Lock down designs upstream
* Invest more time in estimation
* Pressure teams to commit to deadlines
* Dedicate all energy to "the project"
* Ship and move on
* Visualize work against a calendar
* Worry about predictability. Make predictability the goal
