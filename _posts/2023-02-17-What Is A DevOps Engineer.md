# Devops Engineer Fundamentals

A "DevOps Engineer" should be defined as so:
* DevOps is a methodology, not an individual task
* A DevOps Engineer has a responsibility to deliver that methodology

"DevOps" should:
* Abstract a technical solution from key business milestones
* Provide a technical solution for key business milestones
* Prioritise business milestones far before technical milestones
* Distill the technical side for Functional teams

DevOps is measured by:
* Deployment frequency
* Change lead time
* Change failure rate
* Time to restore services

Systems that have been improved by DevOps might be:
* Scalable
* Highly Available
* Secure
* Reliable
* Automated
* Observable
* Built using Agile
* Have very fast feedback loops

As a DevOps engineer, problems should be solved by:
* Being an enabler not a problem solver
* Creating a unified understanding of the problem for everyone
* Putting forward different options 
* Enabling teams

A "DevOps Engineer" will have similar responsibilities to:
* Site Reliability Engineer
* Platform Engineer
* Cloud Engineer

Brushing past:
* System Administrator
* Linux Engineer
* Operations 

A DevOps Engineer aim should be never to "touch" Production.

# DevOps Engineer Metrics

Performance of a companies DevOps movement should be analysed using DORA metrics (DevOps Research and Assessment team, Nicole Forsgren Jez Humble Gene Kim: Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations).

* Deployment frequency: How often a software team pushes changes to production
* Change lead time: The time it takes to get committed code to run in production
* Change failure rate: The share of incidents, rollbacks, and failures out of all deployments
* Time to restore service: The time it takes to restore service in production after an incident
