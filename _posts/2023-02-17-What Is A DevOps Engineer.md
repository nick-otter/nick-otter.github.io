# Devops Engineer Fundamentals

Gene Kim, Jez Humble, Patrick Debois, John Willis, Nicole Forsgren's [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, & Security in Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DevOps-Handbook-Second-World-Class-Organizations/dp/B09L56826R/ref=sr_1_2?adgrpid=54933751562&gclid=CjwKCAiA0cyfBhBREiwAAtStHFf2kVnsLsJG29u-yx3BFyGQPmmsbuCO6-COUPdANu3hWg7Z_IDM6BoCAxQQAvD_BwE&hvadid=259067638720&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9045271&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=16537500343183288233&hvtargid=kwd-298080548321&hydadcr=24405_1748889&keywords=the+devops+handbook&qid=1676886524&sr=8-2) has worthy DevOps definitions and responsibilities. Using that as a foundation and combined with my personal experience, here's what I think.

A "DevOps Engineer" should be defined as so:
* DevOps is a methodology, not an individual task
* A DevOps Engineer has a responsibility to deliver that methodology

"DevOps" should:
* Abstract a technical solution from key business milestones
* Manage and deliver the technical solution for key business milestones
* Prioritise business milestones far before technical milestones
* Distill the technical side for Functional teams

DevOps is measured by:
* Deployment frequency
* Change lead time
* Change failure rate
* Time to restore services

Systems that have been improved by DevOps might be:
* Scalable
* Highly Available
* Secure
* Reliable
* Automated
* Observable
* Built using Agile
* Have very fast feedback loops

As a DevOps engineer, problems should be solved by:
* Being an enabler not a problem solver
* Creating a unified understanding of the problem for everyone
* Putting forward different options 
* Enabling teams

A "DevOps Engineer" will have similar responsibilities to:
* Site Reliability Engineer
* Platform Engineer
* Cloud Engineer
* Scrum Master

Brushing past:
* Solutions Architect
* System Administrator
* Linux Engineer
* Operations 

A DevOps Engineer aim should be never to "touch" Production.

# DevOps Engineer Metrics

Performance of a companies DevOps movement should be analysed using DORA metrics (First discussed in [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1950508641/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=accelerate+the+science+of+lean+software&qid=1676886447&s=books&sprefix=Accelerate+the+scie%2Cstripbooks%2C75&sr=1-2) - Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps).

* Deployment frequency: How often a software team pushes changes to production
* Change lead time: The time it takes to get committed code to run in production
* Change failure rate: The share of incidents, rollbacks, and failures out of all deployments
* Time to restore service: The time it takes to restore service in production after an incident
