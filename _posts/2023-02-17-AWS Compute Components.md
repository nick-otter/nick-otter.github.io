# AWS Compute Components
{: style="text-align: center"}

| Category | Service | Descri­ption |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Instances (Virtual machines) | EC2 | Provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It makes web-scale cloud computing easier for develo­pers |
| | EC2 Spot | Use spare EC2 capacity, cheaper than on demand. | 
| | EC2 Autosc­aling | Automa­tically add or remove compute capacity to meet changes in demand. |
| | Lightsail | Designed to be the easiest way to launch & manage a virtual private server with AWS. An easy-t­o-use cloud platform that offers everything need to build an applic­ation or website. |
| | Batch | Enables develo­pers, scient­ists, & engineers to easily & effici­ently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. Fully managed batch processing at any scale.|
| Containers | Elastic Container Service (ECS) | Highly secure, reliable, & scalable way to run contai­ners.|
| | Elastic Container Registry (ECR) | Easily store, manage, & deploy container images.|
| | Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) | Fully managed Kubernetes service.|
| | Fargate | Serverless compute for contai­ners.|
| Serverless | Lambda | Run code without thinking about servers. Pay only for the compute time you consume.|
| Edge and hybrid | Outposts | Run AWS infras­tru­cture & services on premises for a truly consistent hybrid experi­ence.|
| | Snow Family | Collect and process data in rugged or discon­nected edge enviro­nments.|
| | Wavelength | Deliver ultra-low latency applic­ation for 5G devices.|
| | VMware Cloud on AWS | Innovate faster, rapidly transition to the cloud, & work securely from any location.|
| | Local Zones | Run latency sensitive applic­ations closer to end-users.|
