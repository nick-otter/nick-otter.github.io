[Daniele Polencic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielepolencic/) at [Learn K8s](https://learnk8s.io/) recently published ["A visual guide on troubleshooting Kubernetes deployments"](https://learnk8s.io/troubleshooting-deployments).
It's the most concise breakdown for troubleshooting K8s I've seen. I recommend reading it. 

The main piece is this flow chart. It's well woth reading through too [here](https://learnk8s.io/troubleshooting-deployments).
