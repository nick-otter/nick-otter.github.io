# Common Load Balancing Strategies
{: style="text-align: center"}

From [Leo Coelho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-coelho/).

# Introduction

The primary responsibility of a Load Balancer is to evenly distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or containers.

üëâ When an incoming request (external traffic) reaches the #apigateway, it forwards the request to the #loadbalancer. Then:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The Load Balancer applies its load balancing strategy to select an available container to handle the request.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The Load Balancer routes the request to the chosen container running the application.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The container processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the client (via the Load Balancer and API Gateway).

Here are some common load-balancing strategies.

# Round Robin

1Ô∏è‚É£ Round Robin: distributes sequentially across the available containers.

# Least Connection 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Least Connection: forwards to the container with the fewest active connections.

# IP Hash

3Ô∏è‚É£ IP Hash: use the client's IP address to determine the container to handle the request. It ensures that a given client always reaches the same container.

# Weighted Round Robin

4Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Round Robin: Each container is assigned a weight, and requests are distributed based on the assigned weights. Containers with higher weights receive a proportionally larger share of requests.
