# How to reduce the size of Docker Images
{: style="text-align: center"}

From [Raghav Dua](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/raghavdua_docker-optimization-devops-activity-7085445301917872128-oDxa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android).

If you’re reading this, chances are you’re running very large Docker containers in production.
A Container that’s several gigabytes in size slows deployments, increases bandwidth & storage costs and consumes valuable time of developers.


So here’s how you make Docker Images slimmer:

👉 Leverage Multi-stage builds
Multi-stage builds separate the build environment from the final runtime environment. They allow you to compile & package your application in one stage and then copy only the necessary artifacts to the final image, reducing its size significantly.

👉 Build Images from Scratch
If you only need to run a statically-compiled, standalone executable (like a C++ or Go application), pack it inside an empty Image by using “scratch” as the base image.

👉 Use fewer Layers
Each instruction like RUN or COPY adds another layer to your image, thus increasing its size. Each layer comes with its own metadata & file system structures. The fewer layers you use, the lesser data overhead your image has.

*Bonus* 

My thoughts around it other than the points mentioned
- We may not always be required to build a scratch image, so in that case we should pick up an alpine distribution that ensures we have minimum kernel utilities that helps to run the application as well the size is comparatively small
- Leveraging image compression tools to minimize the image size

- .dockerignore file can help us to avoid copy unnecessary files and reduce the image size too.
