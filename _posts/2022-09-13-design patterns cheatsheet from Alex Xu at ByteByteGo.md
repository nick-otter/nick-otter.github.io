# Design Patterns
{: style="text-align: center"}

From Alex Xu at ByteByteGo.

[Alex Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexxubyte/) at [ByteByteGo](https://bytebytego.com/) recently published ["Design Patterns cheatsheet"](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep17-design-patterns-cheat-sheet).

The main piece is this flow chart. It's well worth reading through too [here](https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep17-design-patterns-cheat-sheet).
