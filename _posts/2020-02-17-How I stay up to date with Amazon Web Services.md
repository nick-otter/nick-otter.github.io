# Introduction

Pretty simply; this is how I stay up to date with AWS. It's great and all, but there are always **alot** of updates to stay across. Here's the pinch points for me that condense the right info.

**TL;DR** if you just want the links:

# Last Week in AWS

Alongside the great podcast **[Screaming in the cloud](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/)**, this lighthearted tone news source is where it's at. A nice resource for AWS billing tips too :/ (sigh).

Visit the website and sign up to the mailing list at **[lastweekinaws.com](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/)**.


# AWS DevOps Blog

Amazon host a DevOps blog themselves (sort of). If you filter their blogs page by the tag DevOps, alot of useful articles pop up regularly.
You can check out their DevOps blog at **[aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/)**.

# The Amazon Builders' Library

You can check out the Amazon Builders' library at **[aws.amazon.com/builders-library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/?cards-body.sort-by=item.additionalFields.customSort&cards-body.sort-order=asc)**. It's endless inspiration for implementation.

# AWS re:invent

I'm sure you might know this one...

AWS re:Invent is an annual learning conference hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the global cloud computing community. The event features keynote announcements, launches, sessions, and more.

You can subscribe to AWS re:invent updates on their site **[reinvent.awsevents.com](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/#footer)**.
