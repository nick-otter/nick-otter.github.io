# Overview of AWS 2020 for DevOps

Let's take a look over 2020 in AWS. Some great new products arrived for your estate.

!NEW **Distributed Load Testing** | [Distributed Load Testing on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/)
* This is an **AWS Solutions Implementation**. A **CloudFormation** template that deploys a distributed load tester API, which uses the **Amazon API Gateway** to invoke microservices (**AWS Lambda** functions). Cost is tied to the Lambda requests.

!NEW **AWS Copilot** | [Get started with AWS Copilot by deploying an Amazon ECS application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/getting-started-aws-copilot-cli.html)<br>
* **AWS Copilot** is a **CLI** for container management and deployment for ECS. This might be helpful for spiking. A quick look at the flow, it won't be great as an **IaC** solution for a microservice build step.

!NEW **AppStream 2.0** | [Amazon AppStream 2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/?blog-posts-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&blog-posts-cards.sort-order=desc), [Cloud Application Streaming whitepaper](https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/AppStream2.0/Accelerate%20Cloud%20Adoption%20With%20Application%20Streaming.pdf)<br>
* This isn't new to 2020, but it was one of the most updated products in 2020 AWS, with 10 new patches. A fully managed non-persistent application and desktop streaming service. There's a nice comparison to Citrix workspace [here](https://www.cloudhesive.com/blog-posts/comparing-appstream-2-0-and-citrix-for-workplace-app-streaming/) and here's a helpful [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/8wxnsx/is_anyone_actually_using_appstream/), 

!NEW **CloudWatch Lambda Insights** | [Using Lambda Insights in Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-insights.html)<br>
* A monitoring and troubleshooting solution for serverless applications running on AWS Lambda. Hooray! System-level metrics: CPU time, memory, disk/network usage, cold starts and Lambda worker shutdowns. Great.

!NEW **SQL Server Reporting Services** | [Configuring Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services on Amazon RDS for SQL Server](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/configuring-microsoft-sql-server-reporting-services-on-amazon-rds-for-sql-server/)<br>
* **Amazon RDS for SQL Server** now supports **SSRS**, giving you the ability to host the report server web portal on the same Amazon RDS DB instance as your SQL Server database. 

Other interesting products that might be relevant:

* New **AWS Public Datasets** were made available from [Ford, NASA and NREL](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/01/new-aws-public-datasets-available-from-ford-nasa-nrel/). 

* Some new articles were added to the great **Amazon Builders' Library** that you can visit [here](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/?cards-body.sort-by=item.additionalFields.customSort&cards-body.sort-order=asc) 

* New [Training and Certifcation](https://aws.amazon.com/training/) courses were added.

# And the rest...

As a bit of an overview let's take a look at the other developments. In the [AWS product log](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/) for 2020, the list has over 2000 entries. Let's take a look at how many updates there were per product to get an overview of all products that were updated.

This should do it.

```bash
$ lynx -dump -nolist https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/ | 
grep -B 2 "Posted On" |
tr -d "[:space:]" | 
grep -wo '[[:alnum:]]\+' | 
sort | 
uniq -cd | 
sort -k1,1n
```

This is a pretty rudimentary search. It isolates the product names in the headers and the dates of all entries on the [AWS product log](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/) page for 2020.

**`The results`**

The three most updated AWS products in 2020 were: 

* **AWS Solutions Consulting Offers** (mentioned `23` times on the [AWS product log](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/) page)
* **Amazon Document DB (with MongoDB compatibility)** (`13`)
* **Amazon App Stream 2** (`10`)

The number of mentions here can be synonymous with product updates. So there were `23` updates to the **AWS Solutions Consulting Offers** product in 2020 and `13` for the **Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)**.

The most mentioned regions were **US** (`93`), **Milan** (`59`), **CapeTown** (`47`). With the most product updates on **Dec 1** (`47`), **Dec 15** (`32`), **Nov 24** (`45`). Can you feel that end of year squeeze.
