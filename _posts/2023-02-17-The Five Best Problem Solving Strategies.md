# Introduction

Fundamental to DevOps or any other practise. Here are some problem solving strategies from [Alex Brogan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-brogan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAABy3JRkBZiQl71f7RJ7FuE7Xo0JOVgI2zME&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BJ3Kzuc6UTfyAH66A57pjvg%3D%3D).

# The Five Whys Method

It's very simple to react to a stated problem without addressing the root cause.

What you hear or see when something is initially presented to you is usually the surface-level pain point or struggle.

By asking the right questions, you can get to the root and find a solution.

Here are the five questions:

1. Why?
2. Why?
3. Why?
4. Why?
5. Why?

See this in action with: [Richard Feynman, Magnets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1lL-hXO27Q)

# The Minto Pyramid Principle

A McKinsey developed framework for writing and presenting ideas.

"A tool to help you find out what you think."

Process:

1. Start with the problem first

2. Group and summarize your supporting arguments

3. Logically order your supporting ideas

# Ishikawa Diagram

A diagram indicating the possible root causes of a problem.

Steps:

1. Define the problem (Product failure)

2. Identify contributing factors (Blue ovals)

3. Find possible root causes related to each factor (Black text and arrows)

4. Analyse the diagram

# Inversion

Inversion

When problem solving, consider the opposite of what you want—the worst-case scenario or solution. 

Now ask, "How do I avoid this happening?"

Inversion teaches you what to avoid on the path to success. 

Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking excellence.

# Issue Trees

Issue trees are a visual diagram that help you break down a larger problem or question into several smaller, more solvable questions. 

They allow you to identify the root causes of a problem as well as to identify its potential solutions.

# A Bonus Round

Questions to help you face reality:
* What’s happening now? 
* What do you need to know?
* What’s working well and what isn’t? 
* What kept you from trying other things?  
* Where are you now in relation to your goal? 
* What is preventing you from obtaining your goals?

Questions to help you discover what you will do:
* What do you need to put into place first? 
* What actions will you take over the next week? 
* What will be the next step you take in the next 24 hours? 
* How/ when/ who/ where/ what will you do to move forward?
