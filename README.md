# nick-otter.github.io

This is the repository for my DevOps blog which is currently hosted at `https://nick-otter.github.io/`.

It is written in `jekyll kramdown` and the current theme is no theme with some awkward HTML parsing. 

To run locally, use. 

```
$ jekyll serve
```

# Files

* `_posts` live posts with header format `YYYY-MM-DD-title`.
* `_config.yml` jekyll config file.

Thanks.
